# Python Maze Solver

**Python Maze Solver** is a project that generates a random maze, visualises it using `tkinter`, and solves it with a recursive backtracking algorithm. The project highlights the procedural generation of mazes and visualises the solving process step by step.

---

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Randomly generates a grid-based maze using recursive backtracking.
- **Maze Visualization**: Uses `tkinter` for interactive visualization of the maze and solving process.
- **Recursive Solving**: Implements a depth-first search algorithm to find the solution.
- **Customisable Parameters**: Allows flexibility in maze size, dimensions, and animation speed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miggoxyz/mazer.git
cd mazer
```

2. Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed (with `tkinter` pre-installed in most installations).
3. No additional external libraries are required.

## Usage

Run the main script to generate and solve the maze:

```bash
python main.py
```
